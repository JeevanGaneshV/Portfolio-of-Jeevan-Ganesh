    "# Actions and Recommendations\n",

    "1. **Investigate trends in how consumers use Bellabeat smart devices for fitness tracking.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   From the analysis, we observed several key trends in how consumers use Bellabeat smart devices:\n",
    "   - Users tend to be more active on weekends, with a noticeable increase in total active hours and steps taken starting from Sunday, followed by a gradual decline throughout the week. This suggests higher motivation levels on weekends due to more available time.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Users within the 85 kg to 95 kg weight range are the most active, with activity levels decreasing beyond this range.\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - Users exhibit high levels of sedentary behavior, averaging 15.87 hours per day, significantly higher than the recommended 6 to 8 hours.\n",
    "     \n",
    "   - The average sleep duration is 6.98 hours per night, with 54% of users sleeping less than the recommended 7 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Identify how these usage trends can be applied to the Bellabeat app.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - Develop personalized activity plans and reminders in the Bellabeat app that motivate users to increase their activity levels on weekdays, addressing the drop in physical activity during this period.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - Introduce weekend challenges or rewards in the app to capitalize on the higher motivation levels during weekends.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - Implement sedentary alerts in app to encourage users to move more frequently and reduce sedentary hours.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - Offer sleep improvement programs and features in the Bellabeat app, providing tips and reminders to help users achieve the recommended 7 hours of sleep.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - Integrate weight management tools in the app that provide tailored activity recommendations for users based on their weight (making weight a mandatory field to be entered), encouraging those in higher weight ranges to increase their activity levels.\n",
    "      \n",
    "4. **Use the insights gained to recommend strategic enhancements in Bellabeat's marketing efforts, aligning them with consumer behavior and preferences observed in the data.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - Launch targeted marketing campaigns that emphasize the importance of staying active during weekdays and highlight the features of Bellabeat devices that support this goal.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - Showcase testimonials and success stories of users who have improved their activity levels and overall wellness using Bellabeat products, particularly those who were able to increase their weekday activity and reduce sedentary time.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - Create and share educational content on social media that explain the benefits of regular physical activity, proper sleep, and reduced sedentary behavior, and how Bellabeat products can assist in achieving these goals.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - Introduce promotional offers and discounts on Bellabeat devices during weekends to use the higher motivation levels and encourage new users to start their wellness journey.\n",
