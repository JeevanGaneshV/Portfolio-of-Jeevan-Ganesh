This involved removing duplicates by using the address as a primary key, eliminating unused columns, and formatting string fields to enhance consistency. After cleaning the data, we conducted an in depth analysis focusing on key aspects such as the number of restaurants in different locations, highly rated dining spots, and budget-friendly as well as expensive areas. We also examined the most popular cuisines, and restaurants with multiple branches. The analysis utilized Tableau for creating visualizations that highlighted trends in restaurant locations, user ratings, and price distributions across Chennai.

### Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into Chennai's food scene, highlighting popular dining hubs and highly rated restaurants. It revealed economic disparities reflected in dining preferences and spending habits across different areas. The findings suggest strategic marketing efforts should focus on popular dining spots and emerging areas, encourage user reviews, and promote vegetarian restaurants to cater to the city's significant vegetarian population.
